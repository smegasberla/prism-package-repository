Prism Package Manager — How It Works
Architecture
The package manager is serverless — no backend, no database, no API gateway. Everything runs through GitHub:
[Your Machine]          [GitHub Registry Repo]         [Package Source Repo]
     │                         │                              │
     ├─ prism publish ────────►│  Fork → Branch → PR ──►  GitHub Action
     │                         │  auto-merges, builds tree   │
     │                         │                              │
     ├─ prism install ────────►│  Pull registry ─────────►  git clone
     │   ~/.prism/registry/    │  Resolve path               │  → ~/.local/lib/prism
Registry Structure (Cargo-style path partitioning)
Packages live in a GitHub repo ( prism-package-repository ) organized by name length to avoid flat-directory performance issues:
index/
├── 1/a            ← 1-char names (e.g., "a")
├── 2/go           ← 2-char names (e.g., "go")
├── 3/h/hub        ← 3-char names, grouped by first letter
└── ht/tp/http     ← 4+ char names, grouped by first two / next two letters
Each file is newline-delimited JSON (like Cargo), one version per line:
// json
{"vers":"0.1.0","repo":"https://github.com/prism-packages/http","deps":["json"]}
{"vers":"0.2.0","repo":"https://github.com/prism-packages/http","deps":["json","ssl"]}
The last line is always the latest version.
 prism publish 
prism publish
1. Validates  prism-package.json  (name, version, repo — all checked for shell-safe characters)
2. Forks the registry repo via GitHub API using your  PRISM_GITHUB_TOKEN 
3. Creates a branch  publish/<name>-<version>  with the metadata
4. Opens a PR — a GitHub Action auto-validates, computes the correct path, appends the entry, and squash-merges
 prism install 
prism install http
1. Syncs registry to  ~/.prism/registry/  (git clone on first use, git pull after)
2. Resolves path — knows exactly where to look:  index/ht/tp/http  for "http"
3. Parses the last line to get the latest version + repo URL
4. Clones the package repo into  ~/.local/lib/prism/packages/http/ 
For local packages:  prism install ./my-package  just copies the folder.
Security
- No shell injection: package names, versions, and repo URLs are validated against strict character allowlists before ever touching  system() 
- No token in process listings: Git auth uses  GIT_ASKPASS  with a temp script instead of embedding the token in clone URLs
- Curl payloads: single-quote escaping prevents shell break-out in GitHub API calls
No infrastructure costs
The entire system runs on GitHub's free tier:
- Registry storage = a public GitHub repo
- Publishing automation = a GitHub Action in  .github/workflows/publish.yml 
- Package hosting = package authors' own repos (linked by URL in the registry)
